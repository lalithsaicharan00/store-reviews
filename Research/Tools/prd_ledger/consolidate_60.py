"""Consolidation pass after report 60 (Report Synthesis Prompt, run order step 5).
Covers the canonical points created or extended by reports 52-60 (C269-C277 and every older point they touched).
Over canonical.json only. Merges true duplicates, widens a title its evidence has outgrown, records every change in merged_from.
Nothing is deleted: a merged-away point keeps its entry with merged_into set and its cards moved to the target.
Run after Tools/prd_ledger/60/merge.py.
